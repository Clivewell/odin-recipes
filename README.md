# odin-recipes

This project is a basic webpage of recipes completed as part of The Odin Projects' curriculum.  The skills learned thus far have allowed me to create the elements within the webpage, including;
    --HTML Boilerplate
    --HTML Tags (p,a,img,ul,ol,li etc)
I have also learned how to structure the files that make up the webpage and utilise Git and the Terminal.
